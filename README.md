# WhatsApp Bot

This is a simple Web WhatsApp Bot developed in python using Selenium. 
Selenium is used mainly for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that. Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should!) be automated as well.

Selenium has the support of some of the largest browser vendors who have taken (or are taking) steps to make Selenium a native part of their browser. It is also the core technology in countless other browser automation tools, APIs and frameworks.

### Installation

Step 1: Install Selenium

> For [Click for safari](https://webkit.org/blog/6900/webdriver-support-in-safari-10)

Step 3: Extract the downloaded driver onto a folder

Step 4: Set path variable to the environment. Paste this command to the terminal
```sh
$ export PATH=$PATH:/home/path/to/the/driver/folder/
Eg: $ export PATH=$PATH:/home/harshit/Desktop/WhatsAppBot
```
Step 5: run whatsapp.py using Python3
```sh
$ python3 whatsapp.py
```
Step 6: When the browser is opened, web.whatsapp.com will be opened and will ask to scan a QR code when you do it for the first time.

Step 7: After Scanning the QR code, you will be asked to press Enter Key in the terminal.
